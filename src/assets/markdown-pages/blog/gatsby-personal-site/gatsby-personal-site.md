A personal website is a great tool for showing the world exactly what you are about. It is akin to an online business card for developers and designers who conduct most of their business on the internet. Having a personal website can be a great way of displaying your best projects, sharing your thoughts, as well as helping people connect with you. 

In order to ensure a smooth user and developer experience, it is essential for a personal website to cover the following three foundational pillars: 
  1. __Performance__ - The website must load quickly on first load as well as between pages
  2. __Design__ - The website must have a simple and intuitive design
  3. __Maintainability__ - Adding posts and editting the website must not be overbearing 

GatsbyJS is the perfect framework that allows developers to seamlessly cover the these pillars.

## 1. Performance
Being a developer, it is of utmost importance that your website loads quickly on each and every page.
