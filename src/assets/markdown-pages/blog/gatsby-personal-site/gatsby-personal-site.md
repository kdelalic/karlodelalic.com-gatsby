A personal website is a great tool for showing the world exactly what you are all about. They are akin to online business cards for developers and designers who spend most of their time on the internet. Having a personal website can be a great way of displaying your best projects, sharing thoughts, as well as helping people connect with you. 

In order to ensure a smooth user and developer experience, it is essential for a personal website to cover the following three foundational pillars: 
  1. Performance - The website must load quickly on first load as well as between pages
  2. Design - The website must have a simple and intuitive design
  3. Maintainability - Adding posts and editting the website must not be overbearing
